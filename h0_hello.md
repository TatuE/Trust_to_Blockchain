# H0 Hello

## Assignment

>This exercise is the first, easy step towards version control systems. Even though you're just clicking buttons on the website, it uses world leading tool git in the background. Git even uses a tree of hashes of blocks, just like Bitcoin.
>- Create a web page using Github. Return it to Laksu, and cross evaluate two.
>### Tips
>-  Read this first: Karvinen 2023: Create a Web Page Using Github
>-  Write the page in Markdown. Add headings and paragraphs.
>-  Browse to the page where you can see your new page normally (headings in bigger text than paragraphs). The correct link to return is shown in your browsers address bar.
>-  Remember to use md suffix, so that the website knows it's Markdown. E.g. "tero.md".
>-  Normally, the cross evaluation has free form feedback: good, bad, ideas for improvement, tips... But for this h0, there is not much to comment and one sentence is enough. If you can see a page with paragraph and heading, it's a five. (For the rest of the course, in feedback for actual homework (h1, h2...), your classmates will surely appreciate longer and insightful feedback).
