### Helsec November 2024 Meetup

I managed to get a ticket for his event and ended up staying through the whole event (expect for networking and after party, it was a normal weekday after all).

All in all the event was quite pleasant. The venue was excellent for the purpose, there was even free pizza, for which I did not partake since I was tourist, let's not start free loading from the get go.

So, on with the assignment, the show.
