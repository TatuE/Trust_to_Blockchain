# h1 Adversarial mindset

>*You will read the famous cyber kill chain paper. And start your very own hacking lab by installing Linux virtual machine.*
>*You can only start this homework after accepting course rules in Moodle.*

## Assignment

>x) Read and summarize. Some bullets is enough for a summary.
>- Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains
>- Darknet Diaries. Pick one episode. (RSS feed)
>- MITRE ATT&CK FAQ explains the ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix. Explain "tactic", "technique" and "procedure" in context of ATT&CK, and give an example of each. The enterprise matrix is big, you can just glimpse/browse it to see what's available instead of reading hundreds of pages.

>a) How would you compare Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK Enterprise matrix? Who do you think could benefit from these models?

>b) Pick a security incident and learn about it. Write briefly about it. Point out the concepts of threat actor, exploit, vulnerability and (business) impact. (You can find writeups about security incidents from Darknet Diaries and Krebs)

>c) Install Debian on Virtualbox. Report your work, including the environment (including host OS, the real physical computer used), the steps you took and their results.

>d) Voluntary bonus: Use either (Hutchins et al 2011) cyber kill chain or MITRE ATT&CK framework for analyzing a security incident. You can pick any incident you want (even the one you used earlier in this homework), but try to pick a source that gives you enough technical and business detail to do some analysis. (If you're in a hurry, cyber kill chain is much simpler. If you're technically skillful, you might find ATT&CK interesting)

>e) Voluntary bonus: What do you consider the fundamentals of security? What are the theoretical foundations you would teach on the first day?

>f) Voluntary bonus: Do you think anything is missing from these models, Cyber Kill Chain or MITRE ATT&CK?

>### Tips:
>- Some bullets for each article is enough. You don't need to have all content of the long articles in your summary.
>- For the summary, add your own question, idea or comment
>- Hutchins et. al. is the cyber kill chain paper.
>- Darknet diaries: you'll probably have a different episode from everyone else, as long as you don't take the latest episode.
>- To listen to podcasts on Android, you can use AntennaPod from F-Droid or Google Play
>- Refer to each source you've used: the course, the task given, the papers, the podcasts - all sources you've used. All sources must be mentioned in every document, page or blog using them. It's enough to just name and link them, you don't need to write another list in the end. In fact, it's imporant to know wich information comes from which source.
>- My article Install Debian on Virtualbox explains it pretty well.
>- Got stuck with VirtualBox or Linux? Don't worry, computers are like that. Write a detailed report (in your homework) with screenshots. Explain what approaches you took and what happened. List where you found advice or articles. Explain your ideas why it would not work. You'll get help and advise in the class (and that's not all - you'll also get Linux on your virtual machine).
