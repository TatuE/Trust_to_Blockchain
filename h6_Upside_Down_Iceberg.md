>*In Finland, it's legal to use TOR at the time of writing. If you reside in another juristiction, laws might be different. Obviously, it's illegal to do illegal things in TOR, just like it's illegal to do illegal things anywhere. Only do legal things.*
>
>*If you reside in a jurisdiction where using TOR is illegal, you obviously can't install it and do the related tasks. If you cannot or do not want to do the hands-on darknet tasks, the alternative task is: based on literature only (no hands on tests, no installation), compare anonymous/pseudonymous networks, such as TOR, I2P, Freenet and others. How do their goals, technology and other features differ? How are they similar? Add references. Link differences and benefits to technical and architecture aspects.*

## a

>- a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

## b 

>- Browse TOR network.
>  - Find, take screenshots and comment
>    - search engine for onion sites
>    - human rights or civil rights organization
>    - marketplace
>    - fraud
>    - forum
>    - a well known organization (with regular postal addresses, offices or similar presence outside darknet)
>  - Use .onion addresses inside TOR network, not regular (clearnet) websites trough exit nodes.

## c

>- Onion. In your own words, how does anonymity work in TOR? (e.g. how does it use: public keys, encryption, what algorithms? This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

## d 

>- d) What kind of the threat models could TOR fit? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

## e

>- Don't stick that stick. How does PhishSticks attack work? Would a typical organization be vulnerable? Does this link to a broader category of attacks and defenses? How could the risk be mitigated? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer.) (If you want, you can view [PhishSticks on Github](https://github.com/therealhalonen/PhishSticks/) and [PhishSticks Youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@phishsticks_pentest/videos))

## f

>- f) Voluntary: I2P. Install and demonstrate use of I2P.

## g

>- g) Voluntary: Hyphanet. Install and demonstrate use of Hyphanet.

## h

>- h) Voluntary: Freenet. Install and demonstrate use of Freenet.

## i

>- i) Voluntary: GNUnet. Install and demonstrate use of GNUnet.

## j

>- j) Voluntary, difficult: Test PhisSticks USB HID attack on your own computer.
