### Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

The document summarized can be read at the O'Reilly website, **Note that the site requires registration**  : [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)

The document details in general how one way and one-way hash functions work and are used in general and with some technical detail added but without going in to much to the computational details.

## a

>a) Wallet. Create a BitCoin testnet wallet. (For example, electrum)
It took me a few tries to get the leading zero, in this case the string that produced is was *hello-adsf13*

## b

>b) Faucet. Get worthless fake money from a testnet Bitcoin faucet.
c
## c

> c) Giveway. Move money to another Bitcoin wallet. Choose an amount where the last two digists are 73.

## d

>d) Recycle. Move the testnet money back to the same faucet you got it from.

## e

>e) Explorer. Use a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain. Explain what each value and field means. You only need to analyze the block information and one sample transaction, as a block can contain many transactions. Voluntary bonus: Use a transaction that's interesting, such as one related to a crime or other unusual event.

## f

>f) RogeCoin. Critically comment on [Honest Ads: If Cryptocurrency Was Honest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUs5y9leCyA) (Video, about 5 minutes). Identify and list arguments made. Provide commentary to support and challenge each of the claims. If you can, provide references or real life examples to your claims. (This task does not require tests with a computer.)

## g

>g) Voluntary: Bib39ers. Write a bib39 phrase of a worthless wallet on a piece of paper. Hide it in your house to annoy thieves and others digging your stuff. Or leave it on a background of a photo and post it to social media. Optionally add or change a non-default word as an icing on a cake.
