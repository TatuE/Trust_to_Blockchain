For this assignment I ended up looking at the subject with a broader scope in information security, instead of looking for a specific subjects like "brute force attack" or "BadUSb". The keywords in searches that were used are : "security vulnerability" and "information security". I think that the articles I found were quite interesting and enlightening.

### Summary

The way people handle passwords is becoming increasingly important, with the increasing amount of digital services used at home and at work.  
The behavior of reusing or modifying passwords or using external memory storage mediums, like writing them down on a piece of paper, has become increasingly prevalent and poses a security threat, if passwords have been compromised from even one service.

People usually resort to risky password handling behaviors because of the overwhelming amount of different passwords they are required to remember. In many cases this is do to the persons fear that they are unable to remember all their passwords, which should be unique for every service. Security policies often mandate that the same passwords cannot be reused, which leads to people modifying their passwords. This usually means making small changes to the old password to make it more memorable, in most cases the modifications are made to the beginning and/or end of the old password, which makes it vulnerable if another passwords is leaked created in the same manner. Some people are unaware that this behavior poses a risks, but some continue this practice even after made aware of the security considerations, because they see no alternative to the situation or they feel that the risks are not that serious.

It has been proposed, that metamemory attributes could help explain risky password handling behaviors, why people have insecurity in their ability to remember different passwords.  
Metamemory is the persons believe in their faculties related to their memory capabilities.  
Metamemory is presented in seven scales.

1. Strategy - Knowledge and ability to use memory strategies and techniques.
2. Task - Knowledge and understanding of basic memory processes.
3. Capacity - Beliefs and perceptions about our own memory capacities.
4. Change - Perception of the change in our own memory capabilities.
5. Anxiety - Anxiety towards our memory performance and/or the perception of the relationship between anxiety and memory performance.
6. Achievement - Perception of our motivation to perform well in memory tasks.
7. Locus - Perception of our level of control over our own memory skill.

Two studies were performed which measured the participants metamemory in managing their passwords. The study used a modified version of the Metamemory In Adulthood (MIA) questionnaire, which was first introduced in 1988. The results were analyzed to find a relationship between password reuse and modification in relation to password metamemory.
The study results pointed out that from the seven scales of metamemory, anxiety was the only one that played a predictive factor in password reuse and modification in both studies.

Passwords and password security holds an important place in our everyday lives, at work and also at home.  
They protect valuable assets and because of this, many people develop fears that they will forget their passwords, which would cause inconvenience in accessing their services or even prevent the access, consequently this fear increases anxiety which often hinders their trust on their own capability to remember their passwords. This anxiety often leads to insecure password practices, which often pose a security risk for the person and the organization they are working for.

When we better understand how anxiety can affect the persons security behaviors, we can try to implement better teaching and training methods that takes this in to consideration.
The aim would be to incr
