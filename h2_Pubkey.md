## a

>a) Pubkey today. Explain how you have used public key cryptography today or yesterday, outside of this homework. In addition to naming the system, identify how different parties use keys in different steps of the system. (Answering this question likely requries finding sources on your own. This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

## b

>b) Messaging. Send an encrypted and signed message using PGP, then verify and decrypt it. (You can use folders to simulate users, or use two computers or two different OS users. Don't use Tero as a name of any party, unless that's your given name.)

## c

>c) Other tool. Encrypt a message using a tool other than PGP. Explain how different parties use different keys at different stages of operation. Evaluate the security of the tool you've chosen.

## d

>d) Eve and Mallory. In many crypto stories, Eve is a passive eavesdropper, listening on the wire. Mallory malliciously modifies the messages. Explain how PGP protects against Mallory and Eve. Be specific what features, which use of keys and which flags in the command are related to this protection. (This subtasks does not require tests with a computer)

## e

>f) Password management. Demonstrate use of a password manager. What kind of attacks take advantage of people not using password managers? (You can use any password manager, some examples include pass and KeePassXC.)

## f

>*You're using public key encryption every day. If you know what you're doing, it can help you even more.*

## g

>g) Refer to sources. Verify each homework report (this and the earlier ones) refers to sources. Every homework report should refer to this task page. It should also have references to any other source used, such as web pages, LLMs, man pages, other reports... References are mandatory, and must be present in every report. (This subtask does not need a report, you can just do it and write "Done." as the answer for this subtask.)

## h

>h) Voluntary, challenging, requires coding: Cryptopals: Challenge Set 1:
>1. Convert hex to base64 (feel free to use a library for base64)
>2. Fixed XOR
>3. Single-byte XOR cipher
>4. Detect single-character XOR (This looks tough before you have solved 1-3)
